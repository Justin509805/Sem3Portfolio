So before the fourth and final assessment I made sure to add new work or change pieces of documentation that were written in the past tense.

Since I got the feedback on maintaining proficiency, I wanted to apply all of the feedback that I got on each learning outcome. This is an action chosen in line with promoting my personal growth, as the goal is to become a professional. This whole process develops my learning attitude as a student who does his best to keep improving and doesn't settle down once reaching proficiency.</p>

                    <div class="dropdown-content">
                        <p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></p>
                        <p>I feel like I have a good understanding of what I am good at and what I am not. My strengths are also the things that I enjoy the most. I enjoy web design a lot, which is why I feel like my strengths lie there. I also like web development for the most part and feel like I am good enough in that field as well.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Weaknesses I have been working on:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My biggest weakness is procrastination. I start my work too late, which results in a worse outcome due to the time crunch. I have been working on this weakness by actually starting work as soon as possible, getting my laptop, plugging everything in, and diving in.</li>
                            <li>Another weakness of mine is that I am not the best web developer. I struggle mostly with JavaScript, and I have to google almost everything related to it. I also struggle with the responsiveness of my web designs. To work on this, I made my portfolio website responsive, tried new methods, and asked for help from peers. I've also accepted that it's okay to Google a lot.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p><strong>Exploring the Media Field and Future Job Vacancies</strong></p>
                        <p>For me, it is very important to explore the media field, especially since I need to do my internship next semester. Previously, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do after this study, as ICT can be very broad. However, I have applied to a company that helps clients create or improve their brand identity. The company creates websites for clients but is also able to create media products such as logos and other designs.</p>
                
                        <p>I am very enthusiastic about starting at this company in February and feel inspired by the work they have done in the 15 years that the company has been running.</p>

                            <li><strong>a. Action plan</strong> – After doing research, I found a method that helped me with starting. I count down from 3 to 1, and at 1, I stop what I am doing, grab my laptop, plug everything in, and start working.

Almost every time a website is the main thing that's asked for. They build their websites within WordPress. PHP is mostly used in WordPress but it also uses MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        <p><strong>WordPress:</strong> There is an Elementor academy (elementor.com) on Google, which I will be using. It is filled with a bunch of free courses on WordPress Elementor, where you build something like a landing page together with a teacher. I will also look around for other sites, such as WPBeginner, and I will be sure to use YouTube.</p>
                        <p>I have watched a few videos on the site. I am currently mostly busy with finishing my portfolio and getting my laptop fixed before the internship. Meanwhile, in these 3 weeks, I will focus on increasing my knowledge.</p>

I am taking action towards my future goal and learning the things that will help me next semester.</p>
