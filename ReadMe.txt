Portfolio of Justin Veenhuis, It's my Semester 3 portfolio, with the meaning of showing my work and explaning why I achieve the learning outcomes.

You will find:
- Information on work that I did connected to the Learning Outcomes.
- A Projects page (only the current project)

The most important sections are the learning outcomes pages, which you can find by clicking on "Learning outcomes" on the navbar and choosing on the popup which one you would like to see.
