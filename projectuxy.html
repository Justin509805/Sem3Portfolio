            <div class="category-info"><p>The studio that I am in is called "UXY" which is short for "Uxynergy." After brainstorming for names we 
                all voted and Uxynergy was the most popular. After we went for feedback, Josh mentioned that people could pronounce it as "UXY" and 
                suggested that we kept it like that. After research we found out that there is already a media company called UXY so we kept it as a nickname.
