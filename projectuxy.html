                all voted and Uxynergy was the most popular. After we went for feedback, Josh mentioned that people could pronounce it as "UXY" and 
                suggested that we kept it like that. After research we found out that there is already a media company called UXY so we kept it as a nickname.

                        <p>Our brand guide is attractive because we use a well-thought-out color scheme, which is bright and playful. The typography has a unique multi-layered, colorful text effect on each title, making the guide pop more.</p>
                        <p><strong>Validating through testing:</strong>  
                        Minh and I conducted an informal A/B test by showing two versions of the brand guide and color schemes to teachers and students to gather feedback.</p>
                        <p><strong>Visual Consistency:</strong> We ensured the design remained cohesive with consistent fonts, colors, and logos across all materials, like our brand pitch video, matching the brand identity.</p>
                        <p><strong>UX Decisions:</strong> Our brand guide is easy to navigate, readable, and aligns with our brand personality, keeping consistent design elements like the title text effect to improve user satisfaction.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I Did:</strong></p>
                        <p>Me and Minh prepared a short presentation about our brand, team, and what we can offer the client. We had to make a video anyway for Stan and Dirk's class, and we decided that we could kill two birds with one stone by making the video into a pitching video as an addition for our motivation letter. The client said that she liked our brand guide and appreciated the pitch video when we had the interview with her recently.</p>
                
                        <p><strong>How Did It Go?</strong></p>
                        <p>It went well. I agreed with Minh that I would start with the pitch video and get as far as I could, and he would finish it. I managed to get 75% done, and Minh did the extra things like shortening the slides for better flow, changing the background song, and finishing one page I didn't manage to complete.</p>
