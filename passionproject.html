                        <p><strong>Link Between Learning Outcomes (LO) and What I Did:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>...exploring emerging trends and developments in media, design and technologies.</strong></p>
                        <p>Fitness apps are often made with multiple health features such as sleep, fitness, and nutrition.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Light and Dark mode is a trend which has been around for a while.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gamification:</strong> Badges, ranks, and progress bars are often used to keep users engaged.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p><strong>Exploring emerging design trends:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques...</strong></p>
                        <h4>User-Centered Design Principles:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Keeping it consistent:</strong> I used the same color combinations throughout all the pages, including having the same main color green in both the light and dark modes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use plain language:</strong> I made sure to type all of the content myself and have it written in simple English. Think of the lines of motivation, for example.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduce user effort:</strong> I made it easy for the user to find where certain things are. For instance, it's very simple to add a new measure of your weight because of the large plus icon. It is also easy to find the light and dark mode switch.</li>
                            <li><strong>Provide feedback:</strong> If something is clickable, an animation of some sort will be provided. Implementation of popups is also being considered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Simplify navigation:</strong> Five navigation buttons allow users to move through all the pages. For example, users can't go to the calories page by clicking on the calories section on the dashboard.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <h4>Visual Design Techniques:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Color Theory:</strong> Green is often associated with success, progress, and positivity, which fits the purpose of the app.</li>
                            <li><strong>Typography Hierarchy:</strong> Some important features have a bigger weight, such as the amount of weight lost or gained and the number of reps and weight completed.</li>
                            <li><strong>White Space:</strong> I added white space around the edges of the screen so the focus is more on the app. I also implemented white space in places that often feel too cluttered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contrast & Emphasis:</strong> Previously, the blue had too much contrast, which shifted emphasis to the background instead of the content. With a muted green color, the white text inside has more contrast, shifting the emphasis to the content.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In S2, I got feedback from Ame that there is nothing wrong with using AI or code from tutorials, but it would be a good way of learning to let ChatGPT explain the code and then add comments based on this explanation. I have done this for most of the JS in my passion project, and I feel like it has helped me expand my knowledge more. I wrote all of the comments myself in a way that helps me understand whatâ€™s going on better.</p>
