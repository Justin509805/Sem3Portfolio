                            <p><strong>Why Both Github and Gitlab?</strong></p>
                            <p>Throughout the whole study I have been using Github for personal projects and Gitlab for team projects. This has a couple of reasons for me:</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Easier to clone using GitHub:</strong></p>
                            <p>When I want to clone a repository from Gitlab, I have to login. I have to create a new access token and copy it inside my notes and find which username I have to use. When cloning from Github, I can simply clone it without any logins and I can set it up way faster with Github.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>GitLab’s better team management tools:</strong></p>
                            <p>Gitlab feels better to use within group projects since it has features such as permissions, merge requests and issue boards. Which makes me prefer Gitlab for team projects.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>GitLab Gitwiki:</strong></p>
                            <p>At the start of the semester I used Word to document my learning outcomes but this was a pain for the user since they had to download every document. I also prefer using Gitwiki over Word or a Markdown inside of Github since Gitwiki is very easy to use and I have more experience with Gitwiki.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>GitHub’s offers a lot of open-source:</strong></p>
                            <p>I got feedback from Josh once to look at open-source portfolios and projects and see how they implement their Readme files and this helped me a lot for my Portfolio's Readme and other Readme's that I made for the group project and for my passion project.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Separation between personal and group work:</strong></p>
                            <p>By keeping my personal projects on GitHub and my group projects on GitLab, I can maintain a better overview of which work is where.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Previous semesters:</strong></p>
                            <p>I did S4 Smart Mobile last semester and I made friends with a group of 5 programmers who were way smarter than me. They only used Github and thought me a lot about it. This led me to taking a liking to Github and used it for that whole semester.</p>

                        <p>I had a merge conflict once in the group project. I had to choose which one I would send out, and it was a simple fix. Furthermore, it went really well. I am getting used to writing clear comments and committing regularly.</p>

                        <p>In S2, I got feedback from Ame that there is nothing wrong with using AI or code from tutorials, but it would be a good way of learning to let ChatGPT explain the code and then add comments based on this explanation.

I wrote all of the comments myself in a way that helps me understand what’s going on better.</p>

                        <p><strong>How Did It Go?</strong></p>
                        <p>Commenting my code went well in general. Maybe it would have been better to keep these comments going as I was coding because sometimes I got so focused on coding that I forgot to keep writing necessary comments. The Readme got an update and now gives a better understanding of my portfolio. Using ChatGPT to install JSdoc and explain to me how to use it went very smoothly as well.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Important Steps:</strong></p>
                        <p>I found it really important to have extra comments inside of my JavaScript file since that is, for me personally, a weak point. After not having worked on a piece of JS code in some time, my memory of it becomes a little bit foggy, which is of course helped by putting comments. Also, using JSdoc to gain more knowledge about the language was good.</p>

                        <p><strong>I recommend you view the detailed documentation on my Gitwiki since there are a lot of screenshots and links directly to the branches, repositories, commit histories, etc.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Context</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>What I Did:</strong></p>
                        <p>I created a ReadMe file for my personal portfolio website and also created one for our group project. I kept things like installation and requirements in mind, as a ReadMe should help the user get the project working on their system.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. Approach and Process</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>How Did It Go?</strong></p>
                        <p>It went pretty well. I already had one for the personal portfolio, which I got really good feedback on from Josh. This feedback helped me create a better ReadMe for the group project.</p>
