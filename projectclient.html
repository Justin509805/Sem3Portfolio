We could go in any direction that we wanted for the solution which was very cool. We decided to focus also on people older than 17 since this is a world-wide problem.

                        <p><strong>What makes the logo engaging, useful and/or satisfying? And validation:</strong>  
                        The logo has a unique story behind it, making it meaningful for the intended purpose. It has a 2D, simple, and fun design, which we determined best suits our younger target audience through research.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Validating through Testing:</strong> I performed A/B testing with two logo versions to see how our target audience felt about each design.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How I Conducted the A/B Test:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> I tested with people aged 15-24, including friends, students, and family members, all within this age range.</li>
                            <li><strong>Groups:</strong> Group A and B had a similar age range, each representing a mix of individuals from the target audience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test Strategy:</strong> I presented Group A with one sketch and Group B with the other. The participants were asked to share their feelings, describe the sketch, guess its purpose, and rate its visual appeal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The goal was to identify which logo was better for further development. Although the results were close, the feedback indicated which design was the most engaging.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p><strong>Was it a success?</strong> Yes, although the difference was not huge, the results were helpful in identifying the more effective logo for the game.</p>
                
                        <p><strong>...exploring emerging trends and developments in media, design and technologies:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Using AI:</strong> Since this idea was quite unique, I had difficulty finding inspiration or reference images. I used AI to help generate ideas for which clothing piece to use as the shell, where to position the text, and to explore color combinations.</p>

                        <p><strong>How does Duolingo use gamification in order to keep the users engaged in a fun and informative way?</strong></p>
                
                        <h4>Duolingo Gamification Features</h4>
                        <p>Duolingo uses several gamification features such as XP and levels, Streaks and Daily goals, Badges and Achievements, Virtual currency, Leaderboards and Challenges, and Rewards for Mastery.</p>
                
                        <h4>Key Gamification Tactics for User Retention</h4>
                        <p>Users want to be able to see their progress easily and get feedback, which can be offered by increased levels, XP points, and badges. These motivate the users to keep achieving a higher level.</p>
                        <p>Users enjoy getting achievements and reaching milestones. A function like a daily streak and an achievement for getting a flawless round keeps users engaged.</p>
                        <p>Rewarding your users with consistent streaks and goals fosters a sense of accountability and motivation, which will improve long-term commitment.</p>
                
                        <h4>Challenges addressed by Gamification</h4>
                        <p>Users face several challenges that are addressed by gamification.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Motivation and Engagement:</strong> Not many people enjoy being educated, and find it boring. Gamification helps by introducing things like points, badges, and rewards, which give the user immediate feedback and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retention and Long-Term Commitment:</strong> Users struggle with keeping their interest and will lose commitment over time. Gamification helps by introducing things like streaks, daily goals, and levels, which encourage the user to stay engaged.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Learning Experiences:</strong> Duolingo's gamification offers personalization with challenges, learning styles, and user needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility and Flexibility:</strong> Duolingo ensures accessibility through mobile apps and web platforms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community and Social Interaction:</strong> Duolingo uses social interaction within the app, such as leaderboards and challenges.</li>
                            <li><strong>Skill Development and Mastery:</strong> Duolingo offers structured learning paths, mastery quizzes, and interactive exercises that systematically build and reinforce language skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p><strong>How does Duolingo use social media to their advantage to gain popularity?</strong></p>
                
                        <h4>Analysis of Duolingo’s Social Media Accounts</h4>
                        <p>Duolingo focuses on both Gen Z and millennials in the age group of 16 to 34. Besides personalizing and gamification, they invested in creating a playful and fun digital presence on social media platforms. They focus on entertaining videos that match their target audience. Duolingo shows its personality via a fun biography on TikTok with “just an owl tryna vibe.”</p>

                            <p>Sander created a base of questions which I asked feedback on and I got told that they were too detailed since our target audience is a bit too young for advanced English. After that, I took it upon myself to create the survey. I asked feedback on it, made changes to questions, simplified them, deleted unnecessary ones, created a poster for the survey, put it in Google Forms, and summarized the findings.</p>

                            <p>It went really well. I made sure to create iterations based on feedback and write them down in Feedpulse. The survey is clear, short, and it will help us a lot in our project regarding our design choices so that we match user-needs.</p>

                            <p><strong>Understanding user needs for user-centered design:</strong> The survey provided data on target audience behaviors, motivations, and situations. This insight is key to shaping the concept and making design choices that align with user preferences. For example, if users are willing to pay more for sustainable fashion if it’s cheaper than fast fashion, we might implement a discount or reward system to respond to their needs.</p>
                    
                            <p><strong>Based on the answers, we can identify the target audience’s preferences:</strong> If 90% of the target audience is female, we could tailor the design to appeal to that demographic. However, if the split is close to 50/50, it’s beneficial to incorporate both male and female preferences in the design.</p>
