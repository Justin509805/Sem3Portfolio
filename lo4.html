The client said that she liked our brand guide and appreciated the pitch video when we had the interview with her recently.</p>

                        <p>It went well. I agreed with Minh that I would start with the pitch video and get as far as I could, and he would finish it. I managed to get 75% done, and Minh did the extra things like shortening the slides for better flow, changing the background song, and finishing one page I didn't manage to complete.</p>

                        <p><strong>How does Duolingo use gamification in order to keep the users engaged in a fun and informative way?</strong></p>
                
                        <h4>Duolingo Gamification Features</h4>
                        <p>Duolingo uses several gamification features such as XP and levels, Streaks and Daily goals, Badges and Achievements, Virtual currency, Leaderboards and Challenges, and Rewards for Mastery.</p>
                
                        <h4>Key Gamification Tactics for User Retention</h4>
                        <p>Users want to be able to see their progress easily and get feedback, which can be offered by increased levels, XP points, and badges. These motivate the users to keep achieving a higher level.</p>
                        <p>Users enjoy getting achievements and reaching milestones. A function like a daily streak and an achievement for getting a flawless round keeps users engaged.</p>
                        <p>Rewarding your users with consistent streaks and goals fosters a sense of accountability and motivation, which will improve long-term commitment.</p>
                
                        <h4>Challenges addressed by Gamification</h4>
                        <p>Users face several challenges that are addressed by gamification.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Motivation and Engagement:</strong> Not many people enjoy being educated, and find it boring. Gamification helps by introducing things like points, badges, and rewards, which give the user immediate feedback and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retention and Long-Term Commitment:</strong> Users struggle with keeping their interest and will lose commitment over time. Gamification helps by introducing things like streaks, daily goals, and levels, which encourage the user to stay engaged.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Learning Experiences:</strong> Duolingo's gamification offers personalization with challenges, learning styles, and user needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility and Flexibility:</strong> Duolingo ensures accessibility through mobile apps and web platforms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community and Social Interaction:</strong> Duolingo uses social interaction within the app, such as leaderboards and challenges.</li>
                            <li><strong>Skill Development and Mastery:</strong> Duolingo offers structured learning paths, mastery quizzes, and interactive exercises that systematically build and reinforce language skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p><strong>How does Duolingo use social media to their advantage to gain popularity?</strong></p>
                
                        <h4>Analysis of Duolingo’s Social Media Accounts</h4>
                        <p>Duolingo focuses on both Gen Z and millennials in the age group of 16 to 34. Besides personalizing and gamification, they invested in creating a playful and fun digital presence on social media platforms. They focus on entertaining videos that match their target audience. Duolingo shows its personality via a fun biography on TikTok with “just an owl tryna vibe.”</p>

So I did an A/B test to figure out which version the target audience was most attracted to. It went really well, I went to people that fit the age group of our target audience and asked them a couple questions to see how much they like the idea and which emotions came up for them. I wrote all of the data down and analysed them.

                    <p><strong>How I Conducted the A/B Test:</strong></p>
            
                    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> I went to a variety of people for this test. Our target audience was between 15-24. Some were friends, some students in the OIL at that time, and some were family. All participants were within the age group.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Groups:</strong> Group A and B were a mix of people between 15-24, both with an average age that was very similar.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Test Strategy:</strong> I prepared two sketches and showed Group A the first one and Group B the second one.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Questions asked:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What feelings came up?</li>
                        <li>How would they describe the sketch?</li>
                        <li>What did they think the logo was for?</li>
                        <li>A rating on visual appeal.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <p><strong>Test Strategy Details:</strong></p>
                    <p>The test strategy was to show each logo to a separate group that fit the target audience, asking them a few questions about their emotions, opinions, and what they thought. The goal was to see which sketch was better and could be used for further development of an engaging logo for our game.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Was it a success?</strong></p>
                    <p>Yes, even though there wasn't a huge difference between the results, it provided a good indicator of which logo was better and could be used for the next steps.</p>

                <p><strong>What I Did:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Using Scrum:</strong> We have sprints, each lasting an average of 2 weeks. After each sprint, we have a retrospective and we use the Keep, Add, Less & More method. We hold stand-up meetings where we update each other on what everyone is working on, ensuring everyone is up-to-date. Each task is linked to the respective Learning Outcome it connects to.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Following the Double Diamond:</strong> The group project follows the double diamond method. We are currently nearing the middle point between the two diamonds. I apply this method to my individual process as well, clearly noting which parts of the double diamond I have worked on. I make sure to follow DD well since it’s what I plan to use for my internship.</p>
        
                <p><strong>How Did It Go?</strong></p>
                <p>The team dynamic has been quite effective as we keep each other up-to-date, ensuring that everyone knows what still needs to be done thanks to Scrum. We hold weekly stand-ups and retrospectives after each sprint to ensure productivity. The first sprint was rough, as we didn’t have many stand-ups and the retrospective revealed many areas for improvement. However, since implementing more stand-ups and retrospectives, the process has been running smoothly.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Link Between Learning Outcomes (LO) and What I Did:</strong></p>
                <p>Using Scrum and the Double Diamond aligns with professional practices by providing structure, especially in a team context. These methodologies help formulate project goals, both during the sprints (Scrum) and the define phase (Double Diamond). Regular contact with stakeholders ensures we're addressing important aspects, and the methods help with decision-making, providing advice, and delivering reports effectively.</p>
